# One-login collector and native reader proposal

Status: read-only Astra Medium consultation, 2026-10-04. Not implemented.
Owner prioritizes avoiding a second login. Keep optimized shared-profile handoff
as the working baseline and Facebook's existing Browser collector exception.

## Candidate architecture

Keep the existing signed-in application profile as the persistent normal Chrome
authentication owner and reader. Give true headless a different user-data-dir.
A Sidecar AuthSessionBroker exports only approved source authentication state
through the private CDP pipe and seeds disposable headless browser contexts.
Do not copy the entire profile or read/decrypt Chrome's cookie database.
An isolated context does not automatically inherit another context's login.

Suggested boundaries: AuthOwner, AuthSessionBroker, DerivedSession, source-specific
AuthProbe and AuthRevocation. Commands conceptually Export, Bootstrap, Validate,
Revoke carry an auth epoch and expected account identity. Secret payloads remain
local and in memory where possible, excluded from public API/status, logs,
receipts, arguments and repository files. This is not permission to export state.

Bootstrap cookie attributes faithfully, including HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite,
expiry and partition keys. Add localStorage/IndexedDB only where demonstrated
necessary; sessionStorage has separate handling. Normal profile is the application
authority. Do not merge headless state back or overwrite active contexts with old
snapshots. Rebuild a stale derived context once at a safe work boundary. If the
owner also needs authentication/challenge, route the user to that same login UI.

States: UNSEEDED -> BOOTSTRAPPING -> VERIFIED; expired/challenge -> STALE -> one
reseed -> VERIFIED or NEEDS_USER. Logout/account switch -> REVOKED; stop work,
discard snapshots/contexts and reject old-epoch results. In-site logout detection
and server session revocation must not be claimed instantaneous.

## Critical feasibility gates

Both browsers can receive server-driven cookie updates despite single application
authority. Concurrent refresh may invalidate the other browser's session. This
is a per-source no-go gate, not something to hide behind unlimited retry/merge.
App-Bound disk encryption differs from device-bound session credentials: portable
cookies do not prove the derived profile can refresh a session tied to a
non-exportable key. X/Instagram/LinkedIn adoption is unknown until inspected.

A persistent normal profile is not proof Chrome can stay alive without windows
or restart without blinking. Test cold start, closing the last reader window,
and keeping the auth owner available before promising background-only startup.
Do not claim a true-headless process can emit normal visible native windows.

## Bounded PoC proposal

Separate authorization before real auth export, new profiles or foreground tests.
Start with local fixture cookies/partitioning, rotation, logout, account switching,
epoch rejection and secret-free receipts. Then test X, Instagram, LinkedIn one at
a time: bootstrap same account, collector/reader concurrency, cross-browser
session invalidation, headless/Sidecar/application restart, observed refresh,
challenge recovery, logout/account switch and expiring media recovery. Keep
Facebook outside this auth research initially. A test across days is useful but
does not itself prove token refresh.

Track bootstrap, concurrency, restart, refresh and revocation independently per
source. An initial success is not one-login durability. If a source fails refresh,
retain its shared-profile handoff. Selective transfer is the main experiment;
full-profile snapshots after verified shutdown are only a possible comparator,
not an enduring sync design. Effort is medium-to-large: two lifecycle owners,
separate leases, auth epochs and worker context routing; reuse extractors,
admission, private CDP and trusted-click reader components.
